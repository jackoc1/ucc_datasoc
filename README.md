I researched and wrote the article on the future of data storage for the second datasoc newsletter. This article was quite challenging to write
as the technology in question is cutting edge and it is hard to find any information on it outside of difficult to read research papers. However, I am proud
of everything I managed to learn and am (reasonably) certain that I made no egregious errors within it.
